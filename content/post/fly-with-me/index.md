I am a private pilot with about [300 hours of flight experience](https://www.arelplane.com/@franklsf) since 2018.
I fly with my friends in small airplanes to fun destinations across California and beyond.
See my [Instagram story highlights](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17878159724249899/) for my flying adventures!

### Frequently Asked Questions

- Where do you fly from? <br> My home base is Palo Alto Airport. I am a member of the [West Valley Flying Club](http://www.wvfc.org/).

- What aircraft do you fly? <br> I fly single-engine piston aircrafts like the Cessna 182 (e.g. [N65504](http://www.wvfc.org/a/wvfc.org/template-2/aircraft/n65504-1)) and the Diamond Star DA-40 (e.g. [N660PS](http://www.wvfc.org/a/wvfc.org/template-2/aircraft/n660ps)).

- How many people can you take? <br> Including myself the airplane seats four people max.

- How much does it cost? <br> I do not charge passengers since this is not a commercial service. We share the rental cost. It is usually around $200 per flight hour.

- How high do you fly & Is it cold up there? <br> We usually cruise at between 5,000 to 10,000 feet (in comparison the airliners cruise at 33,000 feet). It is usually 5--10 degrees cooler than on the ground. There is heating inside the airplane (but no A/C).

- How fast & far can you fly? <br> Typical cruise speed is about 140 knots (160 mph), which means 1 hour to Tahoe, 2 hours to LA, or 3 hours to San Diego or Las Vegas. Any trip longer than these probably needs a fuel stop.

- Can I use my phone? <br> Yes---because we fly low to the ground, cellular signal is usually excellent!
