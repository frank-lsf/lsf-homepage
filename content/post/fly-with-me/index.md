### Frequently Asked Questions

- Where do you fly from? <br> My home base is Palo Alto Airport. I am currently a member of the [West Valley Flying Club](http://www.wvfc.org/).

- What aircraft do you fly? <br> I fly single-engine piston aircrafts like the Cessna 182 (e.g. [N65504](http://www.wvfc.org/a/wvfc.org/template-2/aircraft/n65504-1)) and the Diamond DA-40 (e.g. [N660PS](http://www.wvfc.org/a/wvfc.org/template-2/aircraft/n660ps)).

- How many people can you take? <br> Including myself the airplane seats four people max.

- How much does it cost? <br> I do not charge passengers because this is not a commercial service. We share the rental cost. It is usually around $200 per flight hour.

- Is it cold up there? <br> It's usually 5--10 degrees cooler than on the ground. There is heating inside the airplane (but no A/C).

- Can I use my phone? <br> Yes--- because we fly low to the ground (compared to the airliners), cellular signal is usually excellent!
