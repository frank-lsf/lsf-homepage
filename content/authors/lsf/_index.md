I am a PhD candidate in computer science at the [Sky Computing Lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/) (previously [RISELab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/)) at UC Berkeley, advised by [Ion Stoica](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/). My research interest is in data, AI systems and cloud computing.

I started at Berkeley in 2020. Before that, I worked in [the Big Code team at Facebook](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/erikmeijer1_meta-layoffs-hit-an-entire-ml-research-team-activity-6996955327560650752-QFjV) from 2017 to 2019, where I created AI-powered developer productivity tools. I received my bachelor's degrees in computer science and statistics from the University of Chicago in 2017.

I am an instrument-rated private pilot with [over 500 hours of flight experience](post/flying-milestones).
