I currently work at [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/).

I obtained my Ph.D. in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley in 2024. I was advised by Professor [Ion Stoica](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/). My dissertation is on [_An Extensible Architecture for Distributed Heterogeneous Processing_](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2024/EECS-2024-219.html).
Before that, I worked at Facebook from 2017 to 2019.
I obtained my bachelor's degrees in computer science and statistics from the University of Chicago in 2017.

I am an instrument-rated private pilot with [over 500 hours of flight experience](post/flying-milestones).
