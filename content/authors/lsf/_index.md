I am a first-year PhD student in computer science at UC Berkeley, affiliated with the [RISELab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/). My current research interest is in machine learning and data systems.

I started at Berkeley in 2019. Before that, I worked in the Big Code team at Facebook for two years where I applied machine learning techniques to build assistants that help developers write code. I received my bachelor's degree in computer science and statistics from UChicago in 2017.
